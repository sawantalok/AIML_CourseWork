##Implementing a Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers

###Course Introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

###Skills and Tools

Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Keras, Image Recognition



##Product Recommendation Systems

###Course Recommendation Systems

This project involved building recommendation systems for Amazon products. A popularity-based model and a collaborative Filtering model were used and evaluated to recommend top-10 products for a user.

###Skills and Tools

Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, Python


##Predicting the Strength of high performance concrete

###Course Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning

This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

###Skills and Tools

Regression, Decision Trees, Feature Engineering


##Classifying silhouettes of vehicles

###Course Unsupervised Learning

Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.

##Skills and Tools

Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Classification


##Diagnosing Parkinson's disease using Random Forests

###Course Ensemble Techniques

This project involved using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalise the model for prediction.

###Skills and Tools

EDA, Logistic regression, Decision Trees
